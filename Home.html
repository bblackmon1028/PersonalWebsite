            <h2>Family</h2>
            <p>
                I am married with twin boys, Kayden and Kayleb who are 5 years old. I have a little sister,
                Brianna, who is 16 years old. We are 17 years apart! I am also very close with my mom,
                aunts, and cousins. We often get together for group vacations, barbecues and, of course, holidays.</p>

            <h2>Education</h2>
            <p>
                I graduated from Romulus High School in 2007. After graduation I started college at
                the University of Michigan - Dearborn where I graduated in 2011 with a Bachelors of
                Business Administration with a concentration on Marketing. After 10 years in the work
                force, I decided Technology is the place to be. Therefore, I am currently a student at
                Grand Circus Detroit, studying Full Stack C# .Net.</p>

            <h2>Fun</h2>
            <p>
                I really enjoy movies and gaming! I love all of the Avengers movies and actually got
                engaged in a movie theatre during the credits of Avengers: Age of Ultron. I'm very active in
                Call of Duty: Warzone and enjoy playing with a group of friends as often as I can. I also enjoy
                traveling and hope to take my twins to Disney World very soon!</p>
