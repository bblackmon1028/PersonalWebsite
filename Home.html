            <h2 style="color:purple; font-family: verdana;">Education</h2>
            <p style="border-width:2px; border-style:dotted; border-color: blueviolet; padding: 1em;">
                I graduated from Romulus High School in 2007. After graduation I started college at
                the University of Michigan - Dearborn where I graduated in 2011 with a Bachelors of
                Business Administration with a concentration on Marketing. After 10 years in the work
                force, I decided Technology is the place to be. Therefore, I am currently a student at
                Grand Circus Detroit, studying Full Stack C# .Net.

            <h2 style="color:red; font-family: verdana;">Family</h2>
            <p style="border-width:2px; border-style:dotted; border-color: orangered; padding: 1em;">
                I am married with twin boys, Kayden and Kayleb who are 5 years old. I have a little sister, Brianna,
                who is 16 years old. Fun fact: We are 17 years apart! I am also very close with my mom, aunts, and
                cousins.
                We often get together for group vacations, barbecues and of course, holidays.
            </p>
            <h2 style="color:darkblue; font-family: verdana;">Fun</h2>
            <p style="border-width:2px; border-style:dotted; border-color: blue; padding: 1em;">
                I really enjoy movies and gaming! I love all of the Avengers movies and actually got engaged
                in a movie theatre during the credits of Avengers: Age of Ultron. I'm very active in Call of Duty:
                Warzone
                and enjoy playing with a group of friends as often as I can. I also enjoy traveling and hope to take
                my twins to Disney World very soon!
